- [x] remove hyper
- [x] remove http
- [] remove logs/tracing => that's user (developers) work
- [] see how to split crate in features and put "health" into one
- [] make sure /examples is not in the final code
- [] see if we can create a tsu.conf/tsu.yaml (the cheaper/faster to compile and go though) and try fancy things like `force_statuses_on_response: true` to enforce devs to use Response::status(Status:Ok) insted of 200, and others configs like no Response::binary and explici json or whatever
